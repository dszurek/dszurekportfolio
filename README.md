## About

Hello — I’m Daniel, an MS Computer Science student specializing in autonomous vehicle systems, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. This portfolio showcases some of my experience!

---

## Features & Design

- Modern, responsive UI with glassmorphism and some of my favorite color palettes
- Dynamic background particles + parallax motion with Framer Motion
- Accessible and mobile-friendly layout
- Netlify Forms integrated for secure contact form submissions

## Local Setup (Quick Start)

If you'd like to run this portfolio site locally or modify it for your own needs, follow these steps:

Clone the repository and run the dev server locally:

```powershell
# clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/dszurek/dszurekportfolio.git
cd dszurekportfolio

# install dependencies
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to preview the site.

## Deployment

I deploy this site using Netlify. The contact form uses Netlify Forms so messages are processed server-side and routed to the configured email.

To deploy your own copy:

- Connect the repo to Netlify and enable continuous deploys
- Configure site build command `npm run build` and publish folder `dist`
- Configure Email notifications in the Forms section of Netlify

## Accessibility & Security Notes

- This portfolio is static and safe to host as a public repo (no API keys or secrets in the code).
- The contact form is integrated with Netlify Forms and uses a honeypot to reduce spam.
